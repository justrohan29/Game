# learning-my-kid-to-code

trying to get my kid excited about code by writing small programs together. 

these are the results of messy real-time fumbling toward solutions, not careful engineering

## 1. [guessing_game.py](guessing_game.py)

I like this one because (1) I can write it off the top of my head in about a minute, and (2) it's easy to get a kid to come up with the logic on their own.

She likes playing this on her own too.

## 2. [mastermind.py](mastermind.py)

This was harder to get right than I expected.

## 3. [hangchicken.py](hangchicken.py)

Like Hangman, but with a chicken instead. Very satisfying.

## 4. [madlib.py](madlib.py)

Mad Libs! Every kid's favorite. The dataset is from 
a [Microsoft EMNLP paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55593),
consolidated and transformed a bit.
